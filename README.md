# Non-Holonomic-Planner-with-Arc-Length-Parametrisation

This project involves a trajectory generation and planning approach for multi-robot navigation. This scenario works in cases with an initial point and a goal point but can also be extended to cases with multiple waypoints.
The trajectories are generated using cubic spline clothoids between every two way points and Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance ensures collision free motion.
